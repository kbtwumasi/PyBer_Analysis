# **PYBER ANALYSIS**

## **Overview of the Analysis**

In this project, we are using Python skills in Matplotlib, Pandas and Jupyter notebook to analyze data from Pyber.
The purpose of this project is to analyze and create a visual summary of Pyber's ride-sharing data by city type to compare their performace, determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods and nmake recomendations.

**Total Rides And Average Fare Per Ride**

Rural cities had the least number of rides making up of 125 rides representing 5.3% of the total number of rides given by all city types. Surburban cities had a total rides of 625 representing 26.3%, which was higher than the rides in Rural cities. Urban cities had a significantly higher total rides than both rural and suburban cities combined. Urban rides was 1,625 out of the total 2,375 rides given by all cities representing 68.4%.

However, average fare per ride was highest in the Rural cities,averaging $34.62, followed by suburban cities averaging $30.97 and then urban cities averaging $24.53. Rides were relatively affordable in urban cities than in rural cities. This could be attributed to the lower available rides in the rural areas.

**Total Drivers and Average Fare per Driver**

From the summary dataframe, out of the total  of 2,973 drivers, only 78 was available in rural cities, making up just about 2.6%. Suburban cities had 490 drivers available representing 16.5%. Urban cities had 2,405 available making it more than 80% of the total drivers in all cities. Comparing all 3 city types, Urban cities had more drivers than total rides while suburban and rural cities total rides exceeded the total drivers.
  
Looking at average fare per driver, drivers in the rural cities averaged highest,with average fare of $55.49 per driver  followed by suburban cities, with average fare of $39.50 and trailed by urban cities with average fare of 16.57, which is significantly lower than other cities. This could be as a result of excess supply of drivers available as compared to driver availability in suburban and rural cities.

**Comparing Total Fare By City Type**

From the line graph, total fare was highest in April in the rural cities and lowest between January and February. For suburban cities, total fares peaked in February but at the lowest at the begining of the year and right after April. Fares however tend to increase as it gets away from April. Urban cities total fares are lower in the begining of January and start to increase towards February. Even though it drops in March, January still is the month with the lowest total fares.

Overall, urban cities have the highest fares,with fares between $1500 and $2500 followed by suburban cities with fares between $500 and $1500 and then rural cities with fares between $0 and $500.


## **Summary**
It can be concluded that rural cities have higher fares due to the low driver count and rides. The driver availability can be increased in the rural cities to help decrease the average fare paid by customers in order to increase demand. Pyber can also increase its ride demands in all city types through advertisement and effective marketing strategies. It is also recommended that Pyber pay attention to the peak periods in all city types to ensure there are enough drivers to maximize profits.
